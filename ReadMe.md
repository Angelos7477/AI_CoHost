## ðŸ›  How to Add New Personalities
Follow these steps to add a new personality to ZoroBot:

ðŸ“¦ 1. Add the Prompt File
   - Navigate to your prompts/ folder (or wherever you store prompt .txt files).
   - Create a new .txt file named after your desired personality. (eg. conspiracist.txt)
   - This file should contain the system prompt for the AI in that personality.

ðŸŽ¨ 2. Add the Personality Icon
   - Go to the icons/ folder (or wherever your overlay HTML expects icons).
   - Add a PNG file for your new personality.
     - Dimensions: 64x64 pixels
     - Format: PNG
     - Transparent background recommended
   - File name must match the personality name (eg. icons/conspiracist.png)

ðŸ§  3. Update the Personality Map (Optional)
   - If you're using a dictionary (like iconMap) in your overlay HTML or Python script, make sure to add the new personality:
     const iconMap = {
       ...
       "conspiracist": "icons/conspiracist.png",
     };

ðŸ›  4. Update the Bot Configuration
   - In zorobot.py, add the new personality to your valid modes list.
   - Update random prompts in prompts/user_prompts/ if you want unique phrases.
   - Change voice name in zorobot.py if the personality should have a different ElevenLabs voice.
